				<h2>Student Projects</h2>
				<p>
					Students throughout there time at Quinnipiac will program many things in the program. Freshman typically work on smaller projects and for there final in the first course will make there very own game. Sophmores will do larger programs than as freshman since there programmings skills will be much better. Some projects sophmores have done include a hangman game and a maze game. By the time students are juniors they will be finding internships and have a strong basis of programming knowledge. They will typically work on side projects on there own and some for classes. Some projects that juniors have build are a Twitter account finder, a poker game and an account managment planer. Lastly only two students have been seniors so far. For there senior project they created a profusion device along side mechanical engineers for the medical school.

					One student project that can be seen on the GitHub account is SHA-1. SHA-1 was programmed with a junior in software engineering and a junior double major in computer science and game design development. SHA-1 is a hashed based encrypter that was originally made by the NSA. These two students made there own verison of the program in Java while taking a crosslinked class (Cryptography) for computer science and mathmatics.
